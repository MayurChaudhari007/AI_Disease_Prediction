      <p>
        Our AI-powered disease prediction platform is designed to help users
        identify potential health issues early by analyzing their symptoms using
        both traditional machine learning and advanced AI models like Gemini.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can choose between our ML model for quick predictions or our AI
        model for a more conversational, doctor-like experience. Additionally,
        you can chat with our integrated AI chatbot anytime for personalized
        advice.

        <p class="fst-italic text-muted">
          Developed by <strong>Mayur Gorakh Chaudhari</strong>, this project
          leverages both Machine Learning and AI technologies to provide
          accurate and instant disease predictions.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üîç Two Powerful Prediction Methods</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. ML-Based Prediction:</strong> Built using a pre-processed
            Kaggle dataset with multiple CSV files (<em
              >training, description, symptoms, diets, medications, precautions,
              workout</em
            >). Implemented with
            <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong> for accuracy. Input
            includes
            <strong>Name, Age, Gender, and Symptoms</strong> (checkbox-based to
            avoid errors). Output is presented as a professional hospital-style
            report with disease details, description, recommended diet,
            medications, precautions, and workout tips. Users can also
            <strong>download the report</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. AI-Powered Prediction:</strong> Uses the
            <strong>Gemini API</strong> for intelligent, conversational disease
            diagnosis. Generates a detailed medical report including the
            predicted disease and medical advice, also downloadable in a
            hospital-style format.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üí¨ AI Doctor Chatbot</h4>
        <p>
          Integrated AI chatbot powered by the Gemini API that allows users to
          have an interactive consultation similar to talking to a doctor.
          Provides medical guidance, answers health-related queries, and
          recommends preventive measures.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">‚öô Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Python (Flask Framework)</li>
          <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Machine Learning with SVM</li>
          <li>Gemini AI API for predictions and chatbot</li>
          <li>Pre-processed Kaggle Dataset</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4">üéØ Project Goal</h4>
        <p>
          The main aim of this project is to make disease prediction faster,
          more accessible, and reliable for users, without replacing
          professional medical advice. It combines the analytical power of ML
          models with conversational AI for better decision support in
          healthcare.
